# Schema Reference

This section of the documentation is generated directly from [our LinkML schema model](https://github.com/psych-ds/psych-DS/tree/master/schema_model), which contains information about all the files/folders that Psych-DS expects to encounter in a valid dataset, as well as all the rules that pertain to them. The structure of the reference document is as follows:

- [Meta](./meta_overview.md) contains definitions of fields that different objects can take.
- [Objects] contains definitions of Psych-DS objects and concepts
- [Rules] contains rules and error labels/messages for validation of objects

You can access this resource via the lefthand navigation bar or directly via the first link on this page.
