# Contribute

Psych-DS is an open-source project and a community data standard. We invite researchers to get involved not only by sharing Psych-DS compliant datasets, but by encouraging collaborators to adopt the scheme, as well as providing feedback on our tools, our schema, or anything else.

### Ground rules/code of conduct

This project welcomes contributions and contributors of all kinds, and expects you to treat each other with respect. We have adopted a code of conduct based on [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct), which you can see [here](https://github.com/psych-ds/psych-DS/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in full.  Please contact Melissa (mekline@mit.edu) if you have any concerns.

### Create "issues" on our github pages
You can make notes of things you've noticed, features you'd like to request, or bugs you've encountered on any of our github repositories. Issues are monitored by our core team, but they are also a resource for community members to see what is already being discussed / what needs to be done within the Psych-DS community.

### [Psych-DS example datasets](https://github.com/psych-ds/example-datasets)

More is always better when it comes to publicly shared Psych-DS datasets. Anyone can browse this repository of valid datasets to see helpful examples. Please feel free to add your own (anonymized) datasets to the repository. Check out this repository either to browse some examples of what Psych-DS could look like or contribute one of your own.
